        ~Server Rules~</em>  </p>
        <div><li>) Be Respectful.
        Refrain from any content that is:
        Political, abusive, threatening;
        Obscene, defamatory, libelous;
        Racially, sexually, religiously;
        NSFW Comments or Pictures;
        Or otherwise objectionable or offensive.
        Toxic chatting (Don't get on each other's nerves or troll. Enjoy this place!)
        Cursing IS allowed. (To an extent!)</li>
        
        <li>2.) Respect The Server.
        Do not invite any chatbots or attempt to modify the server.
        Do not abuse the bots.
        Do not share any files that may contain a virus, hack, or exploit.</li>
        
        <li> 3.) Do Not Spam: Stay On Topic For Each Channel.
        The channel names are pretty explanatory for what they are. Spamming includes copy-paste blocks.</li>
        
        <li> 4.) Player Etiquette.
        Always treat people fairly and act civilly.
        Help other members when they need it.
        No mini-modding.
        Be courteous in all voice channels.</li>
        
       <li>6.) Do not cause a nuisance in the community.
        Repeated complaints from several members will lead to administrative action. (Includes Excessive Pinging)</li>
        
       <li>7.) Do not impersonate Staff Members.
        We do not like people impersonating someone that they are not.</li>
        
        Server staff have the power to act on any content that breaches these rules or is seen as detrimental to the server. These rules may be subject to change
